# Resume Project

This repository contains the source code for my personal resume website, designed to showcase my skills, experiences, projects, and achievements in a clean and professional format. The project is built with modern web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and follows responsive design principles to ensure it looks great on both desktop and mobile devices. Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, or get inspired for your own resume site!
